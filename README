A jQuery modal plug-in based on https://github.com/FinelySliced/leanModal.js

Changes to the original code:
* fixed bug where a new overlay div is created each time modal window is activated
* defaulted positioning of modal window to the center of the screen
* added a close button
* added a few error handlers
* added a demo page
